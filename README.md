This file is building a tree model named XGBoostTree, including its tree formation and splitting process, applying gradients and Hessians, for calculating the optimal splitting points. 
The model's implementation involves incorporating the key features of XGBoost to enhance the model's control and flexibility. 
Finally, I used the official XGBoost model from the scikit-learn package in the Python plugin from WEKA as the benchmark algorithm, compared it with the self-built XGBoostTree algorithm, applied it to different datasets, and observed its classification accuracy and root relative squared error in both classification and regression cases to evaluate its effectiveness.
